If you saw my most recent [YouTube short](https://youtube.com/shorts/dywnfv9-ISw?si=Hv_CS8W9iqavU4ET), you might be a little confused by what's going on.

The story of Ryder is a long one, so buckle in.

## The birth of RYDER

On March 9th of 2024, I was streaming CS2 as I did frequently back then. I was on with friends, notably [MemesRUS_124](https://linktr.ee/memesrus_124), 
who you would know if you have been here long enough. 

At timestamp [2:38:55](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxkT0pnKew4l4cC8MW7oLI6eagl3dpCRa9?si=gLfT8see0iDJ11l5) I had a nasty flick, died and then read chat.

I believe this to be the first time Ryder ever messaged in my chat.

During the stream I contemplated a lot about whether I wanted to ban him, as you can hear at the end of that clip.
He was barely causing no harm but I've dealt with people like this in the past, and far is *too* far?

One of Ryder's most common things to do was spam the chat and ask me to read his name, which commonly held some form of the N word.

### Potential Contender

Important to note at the time a friend of mine named Dawson just joined the chat shortly after Ryder's arrival. 
His account's name was Lerpes, as shown in the image below.

_Lerpes and Ryder in the chat together_

This is important because Lerpes, or Dawson, eventually changed his username to "RyderRiots".

I thought I had bro dead to rights, even confronted him over Discord:

*Sounds like a confession right?*

Well he claims he actually had no idea what I was talking about. 
I believe him to some degree, but it may be no coincidence they both joined this stream, 
being Ryder's first time and Dawson's first time in a long time.

## Multiple Accounts

At timestamp [3:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/live/rcE7wEJEXvw?si=o3KjsgSR3v3gU1ZG&t=12148), 
being almost an hour later, Ryder is back in chat with a new account named **Ryder "Ninja style"**.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='rcE7wEJEXvw?start=12148' %}

This account seems to be the most active and up to date one, being one that he still chats with, 
but currently being named [@Daniel187ite4g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOI9DFMF-YFt3yE2KtktpgQ).

If you look at the Live Chat in the VOD, you may wonder why you cannot find the previous account, 
and I believe that is because that account was **BANNED** (unsurprisingly).

Over the course of me streaming, Ryder would pop in and out of chats with different accounts 
all of which I have cataloged below:

- Ryder N*****
	- First appeared March 9th, 2024
	- No other known aliases
	- **BANNED** by YouTube
	
- [Ryder "Ninja style"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOI9DFMF-YFt3yE2KtktpgQ)
	- First appeared March 9th, 2024
	- Aliases:
		- RyderWilson - September 13, 2024
		- Ryder L. Wilson - November 21, 2024
		- ADAM IS A N***** - January 2, 2025
		- Adam has big cheeks - January 12, 2025
		- Ryder_1965 - January 16, 2025
		- Now Daniel187ite4g 
	- Still active
	
- [Rugged-99](https://www.youtube.com/@Speed-0171)
	- First appeared ~September 13, 2024
	- Also known as Speed-0171
	
- [Bigg Dawg Slanders](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjB-rxBcInC0h_C9HbCRfiQ)
	- First appeared ~Feburary 15, 2025
	- New in the chat
	- Aliases:
		- MemesRUs
		
These are just what I know, but there is probably far, far more.

Important to note that all of these accounts are made different **YEARS**. How long has this troll been in development?

Now if something seems weird about that last one, it's because **it is**. MemesRUs? Like as in MemesRUS_124?

## Couldn't be my friend...

I only discovered this username change WHILE I was making this silly little meme, 
so now of course I had confront my good friend Memes.

![Desktop View](MemesChat.jpg){: .shadow }

Reminiscent of my [conversation with Dawson](#potential-contender), 
I thought this sarcasm might've been the confession I was looking for.

But after a call with Memes, he reassured me it was not him.

Potential contender? Maybe, but if you remember Memes is the one who wanted him banned and he was playing CS2 on that very first stream.

Not saying it's unlikely he could've been on an alt and playing, but feels unlikely.

## So what is the meaning of the Meme Short?

Well the idea of making the meme comes from something Darryl said on the newest Borderlands 
livestream at timestamp [1:36:58](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxmFmRjkMjhRuXH1cXV84tg_jZMfpL8G9E?si=bz5NXTi0qDnT1rKb).

Below is the reference behind all of the icons and they want they mean to the Spongebob characters:

|![Desktop View](Me.jpg){: .shadow }{: .left } Me, GamingDominari. You really don't know at this point?
Lady|

Do the math and and basically it means **EVERYONE IS RYDER**

## Conclusion

But who really is it? A troll that came around and decided I'd be fun to mess with? 
Someone I actually know, whether that be someone I still talk to or maybe someone I still am talking to?

The world may never know, but I sure as hell will update this memey blog post when I find out.

Thanks for reading this garbage, absolutely **DO NOT** harass anyone here anyone here involved, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

## Archive Links

To perverse the accounts that are still currently active, especially for future viewing, 
I decided to make an archive.org collection here for all of Ryder's known accounts. 
Want to help solve the mystery? This surely will help when these accounts get banned or the names inevitably change.
