description: The good ole Portal campaign as you know it but with a simple twist. Every chamber has a random effect applied to it, so every play through is different. Comes with 10 different random effects and 2 additional game modes!

## Mod Description

This demo contains the first map (Test chamber 00 and 01) with all of the current random effects at this time:

- The Floor is Lava
- Water Flood
- Random Gravity
- Random Speed
- Zombie Spawn
- Turret Spawn
- Neurotoxin Escape
- Lights out

Also try the experimental (and probably impossible) hardcore mode, where every single effect is on at once!

## Additional Notes

This is my first ever public SourceMod I've ever released. I've made plenty of [.bsps in my day](https://steamcommunity.com/id/GamingDominari/myworkshopfiles/) and even some attempts at SourceMods in the past:

_Main Menu Prototype for an old Half-Life 2 sourcemod_

So it feels nice to finally have something out there, even if it is just a demo.

Also cool to see [PCGamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/portal-randomized-mixes-up-valves-beloved-puzzler-by-turning-the-floor-into-lava-and-filling-chambers-with-a-deadly-neurotoxin/), 
[Arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/how-portal-randomized-breathes-new-life-into-a-pc-gaming-classic/) 
and [GameRant](https://gamerant.com/portal-randomized-mod-twist-classic-gameplay/) have all made articles based on this demo!

You can also find a VOD of my good friend [MemesRUS_124](https://www.youtube.com/@MemesRUs_124) playing a pre-release version of Demo 2 on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2389663639)! (although the VOD wont be there forever sadly)
