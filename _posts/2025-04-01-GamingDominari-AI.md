~~He can't find me here...~~

## what the hell was that...?

That was my super fast attempt at an April Fools video. 

I literally made it at work in the span of 4-6 hours. 
Voice was AI (of course) and could've sounded better but I was on a crunch. 
Editing was all me, as well as the sick CS2 BHOPS.

*...man I miss CS:GO BHOP and Surf*

*tryna channel these vibes*

I actually thought about just including this OG footage instead lol

I had a much better idea for the April Fools video this year but sadly I didn't have time to execute. 
I could tell you what it is but depending on type of content I'm making next year, I may use it then! 
If I forget please let me know and I'll append it here.

What I will talk about is previous April Fools attempts(?). I don't have much but there has been some *interesting* ones.

## My first April Fools video

ugh yeah this was it. 

Back in 2015, the funny haha was to make fun of Bronys, a combination of "bro" and "pony", 
and were just people that liked My Little Pony. It was a different time for sure, and to think of it, 
you really don't hear about Bronys nowadays.

I really love how I wanted to make sure **YOU KNEW** I was kidding and **WASN'T** a Brony LMAO.

## My last April Fools video

{% include embed/youtube.html id='jrUjiJDd-A0' %}

The 7 year gap between the two videos really showing my age here on YouTube.

This one I'm really proud of, especially because it's still fooling people to this day.

This video is a big inside joke to anyone who is familiar with one of my most popular videos, 
[How to fully disable grass in Fortnite!](https://youtu.be/xjOS3U27a_4?si=hvkSUP2Y_pLovmAd)

{% include embed/youtube.html id='xjOS3U27a_4' %}

In the Fortnite video I found a decent performance lift with disabling grass, as well as better visibility in seeing players. 

I used this video as a backbone to support my *"disabling grass in Minecraft"* video 
where after disabling grass I instantly get so much more performance 
(with a conveniently timed subscribe notification to block that Fabric is being used instead of vanilla) 
and get to the End after *"doing a little mining off camera"*, 
even getting bedrock and a surplus of supplies.
The instructions are almost even the same to Fortnite as well.

My initial plan for this video was to remove grass from a whole bunch of games. 
I even have the footage where I recorded it for CS:GO! 
Sadly I ran out of time then too as I made the video the day before April 1st.

I could've sworn I made more than just the two of the videos. If I find out I was correct I'll update the post I suppose.
