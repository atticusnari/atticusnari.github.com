## Additional Notes

This is the very first video in a while that absolutely popped off.

As of March 2025 it is at a staggering **2.2 THOUSAND VIEWS**!

I know regardless of the popularity of the series I would've continued it, 
but it definitely felt nice to be rewarded for my hard work after over 10 years of making videos on YouTube.

Thank you all for the support and I'm excited to see what comes after this series :)

Did I get something wrong? Do you hate my opinion? Do you have additional thoughts about my blabbering???
