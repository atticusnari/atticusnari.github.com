**Truth be told...**
## I don't like the name blog

But I do realize that one day sites like YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Ko-Fi etc. won't be around anymore.

That's why I've made this *blog*

It's made with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted with [Squarespace Domains](https://domains.squarespace.com/) (formly with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)).
I've dabbled around with HTML and CSS but without these projects this site wouldn't be around.

In conjunction with this I'm also hosting my own links website, similar to something like Linktree but built with LittleLink, and hosted with Vercel and Squarespace Domains as well.

You should expect updates to all of my different creative projects included but not limited to:

 - YouTube Channels
	 - [GamingDominari](https://www.youtube.com/gamingdominari)
	 - [Adam LaPrade](https://www.youtube.com/AdamLaPrade)
	 - the others (maybe)
 - Streaming
 - Modding
	- [Portal: Randomized](https://www.moddb.com/mods/portal-randomized)
 - Web development
	- [This blog site](https://blog.adamlaprade.me)
	- [My links website](https://www.gamingdominari.com)
 - And other shenanigans I've got going on
 
Whether you actually care about what I have going on, or somehow information I posted here helped you on your adventures across the internet, I'm just glad you're here.

More than anything I just hope to catalog what all I have going on, and being able to look back at my dumb posts one day will surely show some growth I look forward to.

I only have posts going to the first of this year, even though I only started making posts today.

I don't intend to make any posts for earlier than that, as 2025 is the mark for all these different creative projects.
You may find me making blog posts about things in the past though!

Every post has at least one thing interesting to take from it I feel you wouldn't have known otherwise. Go check it out!

## FUN FACT
This is not *technically* my first website. I originally created a website/blog back in 2013 called [DailyMG](https://dailymg.weebly.com/).

The "official" about me section states:
> Daily MG is a site where you can have fun and see the most awesome/bad videos ever. By the way, I hope this site turns to a site just like Facebook.

Needless to say I don't think that ever panned out, but it is a dumb fun read if you're interested in checking it out.

All of my posts have a comment section beneath them, powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/).

Did I get something wrong? Do you hate my opinion? Do you have additional thoughts about my blabbering???
