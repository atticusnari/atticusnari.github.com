This is a continuation of the last ['HL2 Booby Trapped'](https://youtu.be/CJ8EYpdluQE) video. I would recommend watching that one first!

## Additional Notes

Last line the description is a nod to the fact the thumbnail used to have the same background as the original video. Looks much better now!

My favorite comments on these series are ones like @JSwans:

As my reply states, it's absolutely comments like these that fuel the creative train.

Thank you all :)
