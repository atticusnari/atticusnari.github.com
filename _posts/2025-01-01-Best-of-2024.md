## Additional Notes

Like every year, I create one of these Best of compilations for this channel.
It's been a running traditional since 2019 and it's easily one of my favorite videos to make.

Reminiscing on all of the videos on my channel during this editing process is probably why I decided to create this blog in the first place.
Not having to comb through every video every time I wanna look back is nice.

Plus everyone loves funny moments compilations even if they have watched all the videos.

Important to note that at the end of the video I detailed the different types of videos I wanted to make, being challenge runs and playthroughs.

As of March 2025 I've succeeded a fair bit with the birth of [Can you beat Half-Life 2 Booby Trapped?](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlSIK6zoVzZls2U3I7WiR-1oZZHYnFqMd&si=qgrqG1pNmVUGDLAb) but the fun is not over!

Stay tuned for more challenge run shenanigans and more :)
