My amazing girlfriend owns a Etsy shop where she currently creates clay, wire, crystal and shrink plastic earrings and necklaces!

She's currently running a Spring Sale where everything is **20% off!**

Don't wait though, the sale ends **April 21!**

She also has no idea I'm even promoting her page... so go surprise her and get yourself something nice! There is a lot to choose from and more to come :)
