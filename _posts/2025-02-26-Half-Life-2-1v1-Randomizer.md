Was it rigged?

Maybe...

Rematch?

Maybe...

Secret for all you description viewers, mbramblet is actually creating a random effect mod for Half-Life 2 similar to my Portal Randomized mod. This would be perfect opportunity for rematch.

## Additional Notes

mbramblet actually ended up releasing the [Half-Life 2 Randomizer mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/581306) which I plan on making a video on soon, 
although I don't think me and Memes will use it as a challenge randomizer as listed in the video description.

We do however have plans to do other types of these wheel randomizer 1v1s :)

Did I get something wrong? Do you hate my opinion? Do you have additional thoughts about my blabbering???
